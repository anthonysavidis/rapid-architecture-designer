# Rapid architetcure designer

A tool for rapid software architecture design, with split-n-join actions created with HTML, JS and CSS.

## Abstract
Software architecture designing is a stage of vital importance in software development, as its
product acts as a bridge between the requirements and implementation. A well-constructed
architecture offers the software, both short and long-term benefits. It contains the system’s
functional roles and its operational features that are represented graphically by components
and operations respectively. Components often need to communicate and therefore a link
between them is created. The architecture is being altered repeatedly until it reaches its
ultimate form, in which every operation is attached to a component and no further action can
be done upon components.

This procedure is defined by its simplicity and abstraction. However, most of the current
software architecture designing tools do not comply with these characteristics. Instead, they
emphasize on graphical and informational details that might be currently unknown to the user
or may be volatile and will be consolidated in the latter stages of development. As a
consequence, not only do these details become sometimes overwhelming and tiresome but
also the software architect is misled and stalled unintentionally from achieving their real goal.

To offer a solution to this problem, we introduce a rapid software architecture designing tool,
which reduces to the bare minimum the informational and graphical technicalities. More
specifically, it requires only a name and an optional description for the creation of any
component, link, or operation in contrast with already available designing tools. Each type of
these elements has only one graphical representation. Moreover, our tool provides specific
software architectural abilities, in which the user manipulates the elements until all the
system's requirements are fulfilled and the architecture obtains its final form. In this manner,
the user saves a considerable amount of time and simultaneously focuses on making
architectural decisions.
